now why does that matter for human health ?
here &apos;s a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay .
and i remember there sitting at my desk thinking , &quot; well , i know this . this is a great scientific discovery , &quot; but it was so awful .
they &apos;re closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and i believe we shouldn &apos;t tolerate that either .
i started out showing how much we had distressed the monterey bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems .
ak : haa haa haaa .
and just around that time , his mother had said , &quot; have you seen this book by michael morpurgo called &apos; war horse &apos; ? &quot;
ak : we were terrified .
here , craig is working the head .
you see the skeletal structure of it .
so , we have this ability as well .
and you know , our modern ways of doing things have their advantages , but i believe we should understand the costs .
clay shirky , that great chronicler of everything networked , has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way .
there are now , today , so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing , bringing together people around a common goal , to think bigger .
and i &apos;m hopeful because it &apos;s not only philanthropy that &apos;s reorganizing itself , it &apos;s also whole other portions of the social sector , and of business , that are busy challenging &quot; business as usual . &quot;
i keep this photograph close by to me -- it &apos;s in my office -- because i &apos;ve always felt a mystical connection to these two men , both of whom i never knew .
my own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people . 80 percent .
whenever they have a moment they chat to each other .
and when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach , where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere .
we worry that im , texting , facebook are spoiling human intimacy , but stefana broadbent &apos;s research shows how communication tech is capable of cultivating deeper relationships , bringing love across barriers like distance and workplace rules .
one of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehicles -- is what we believe is the world &apos;s first autonomously drifting car .
for instance , the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves .
not a challenging task .
currently , taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail .
her family has eight generations in a town called whitesville , west virginia .
yeah .
we can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing .
and we all need to be invested in it .
and he did sometimes , believe it or not , at a racetrack in los angeles -- one reason to love l.a. -- back in the 1940s .
i started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people .
and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like . &quot;
those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence .
it always takes time .
true guilt arises only from an offense against a person , and a down &apos;s is not a person . &quot;
testing in humans is around the corner .
but i &apos;ve come to feel that i love the children i had so much that i don &apos;t want to imagine a life without them .
he wasn &apos;t extending his legs appropriately .
and i came from a very privileged background . i was very lucky .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . there they are , folks .
this is in the early 2000s . my son , dimitri -- who &apos;s here , many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia , set up this school that we had built , just as the school connected it to the internet .
just keep in mind -- because there are other people , including bill gates , who said , &quot; gee , you &apos;ve got a real computer . &quot;
latin is relatively rare , too . you just look at some of the languages .
and guess what ? we won it hands down .
we &apos;ve pledged not to add features , but to bring that price down .
now to a vegetable plant , my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space .
and we &apos;re able to look out for the needs of newcomers .
so the fiscal cliff , i was told that that &apos;s too partisan a thing to say , although i can &apos;t remember which party it &apos;s supporting or attacking .
wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn &apos;t be called unproductive .
now when it comes to taxes , there is more disagreement .
none of these major theories have been completely successful .
the fear is that the world is watching .
and during a lot of this work , we found something , or i found something , that really fascinated me , and maybe you can remember it .
it &apos;s actually just happened here -- light to dark in six seconds .
i &apos;m watching your faces very carefully .
that &apos;s not the expression of joy .
in fact , this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face , of which both sides are beautiful .
now that thing , light flickers across it as you move , so it becomes a kinetic object , even though it &apos;s standing still -- managed by how brilliantly that &apos;s done on the reflection .
i &apos;ve had to move that part across , but only a millimeter .
and the one i showed you before was , of course , a massively complex one .
it wins or loses at that point .
forming the emotional bond between this thing and you is an electrochemical party trick that happens before you even think about it .
i don &apos;t think we have to make that choice .
it &apos;s also an idea that we have forgotten .
and i think we need to get back to that sermon tradition .
now we don &apos;t think that way .
and at the end of my talk , you would all stand up and you would go , &quot; thank you plato , thank you shakespeare , thank you jane austen . &quot;
the other thing that we believe is that art shouldn &apos;t explain itself , that artists shouldn &apos;t say what they &apos;re up to , because if they said it , it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy .
art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society .
now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way in which they &apos;re doing it .
absolutely . i , like many of you , meet people who say things like , &quot; but isn &apos;t there something bigger than us , something else ? &quot;
because you &apos;ve agreed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you politely differ .
so it took me from places like chile -- the atacama desert in chile -- to siberia , to underground mines in the japanese alps , in northern america , all the way to antarctica and even to the south pole .
it is the largest lake in the world . it &apos;s 800 km long .
and you wouldn &apos;t believe it , but the one after that is going to be called the overwhelmingly large telescope .
this hut was built by robert falcon scott and his men when they first came to antarctica on their first expedition to go to the south pole .
and remember , all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold , in sub-zero temperatures .
it &apos;s kind of an inspiring statement , and i &apos;ll go back at the end of this .
some of the first things that people do is they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books , and that &apos;s kind of fun .
it was quite popularly attended .
but how do you go about doing all this scanning ?
and we &apos;ve been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume .
exactly what loaning means , i &apos;m not quite sure .
and we get about two or three bands a day signing up .
so 15 dollars per video hour , and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour , we &apos;re able to go and get materials online very inexpensively and have them up on the net .
the question is , is that the world that we really want to live in ?
flowers will arrive by the truckload .
we all know the earth is in trouble .
after they sporulate , they do rot .
when you walk across landscapes , it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris .
all across most land masses .
some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms .
this is extremely rare fungus .
i did something that nobody else had done .
the life box -- you &apos;re gonna be getting a dvd of the ted conference -- you add soil , you add water , you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores , like of the agarikon mushroom .
i &apos;ve also lived in biosphere 2 .
we needed to know , is life this malleable ?
i was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way .
and the doctor was , in fact , checking us to make sure we were , in fact , fine .
and everybody ran up to me .
eritrea , formerly part of ethiopia , is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful , incredibly stark , and i have no understanding of how people eke out a living there .
